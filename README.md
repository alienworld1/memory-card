A memory game made using React. Check it out here: [Memory Card](https://mem0ry-cards.netlify.app/)

- Cards with pictures of cats are displayed on the screen
- Clicking a card will load a new set of cards
- Score is added for every unique card clicked
- Score is reset to zero, when the user clicks a card they've clicked before
